â€‹
Create a monkey object, which has the following properties:
- `name` (String)
- `species` (String)
- `foodsEaten` (Array)
â€‹

And the following methods:
- `eatSomething(food)` which adds a new item into the monkey's foodsEaten array.
- `introduce()`: returns a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and the last thing it ate. 

â€‹
Exercise your monkey by retrieving its properties and 
using its methods. Practice using both syntaxes for retrieving properties (dot notation and bracket notation).
